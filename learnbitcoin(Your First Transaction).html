					to know how to send funds from your phone now. I had mentioned before that the donation
					wallet I had set up, I will use it now as an example.

					<p>Now input the amount you wish to send. Any amount is greatly appreciated. 
					Remember, the system works on <b>LOWER</b> fees, not free.  
					</p>

					<p>Next hit the send button. I will get a notification on the wallet right away, 
					and after around an hour the transaction will be finalized. Remember that after you 
					send a transaction, not when it is confirmed, you can not reverse it if it has the correct credetials.
					</p>

					<p>You now know how to participate in the Bitcoin Network. This networks works with the more people who use it. 
					As you see, once you get started, it is not that hard of an instrument to use. If you can spread the word, that will help
					the most. Enjoy the World of Crypto.

	    				<p>When you are going to send a transaction, take a few seconds to check the address. There can be malware that will change the
					address and send it to a hackers address. This can be avoided if you double-check the address before hitting send.
