    			<h2>Mobile Wallet</h2>
    				<p>If you want to have a small amount of bitcoin, more than likely you want to spend it. 
				The quickest, cheapest, and most convienent way is to store it on a mobile wallet. A 
				small amount would be less than $100, BUT always remember to invest only what you can live 
				without. The price of bitcoin is VERY volitile; this means value could drop unexpectedly and 
				you would take a loss if you spend you BTC. If you want to invest more, you may want to read 
				up on Bitcoin, as you should for any investment. Learn about other wallets and how Bitcoin 
				actually works. This site is intended for casual users. If you wish to invest more, click the 
				link below to one of the best hardware wallets on the market.</p>

				<p>Whether you have an IPhone or an Android, you can go to the App store or Playstore and 
				search for Bitcoin Wallet. You should find this app.</p>

				<p>Once installed, you will see a screen similar to this, minus the transactions at first. 
				Notice the wallet is in mBTC, not full BTC.</p>

			<h2>Units of Bitcoin</h2>
				<p>I mentioned that the wallet is in mBTC and not BTC. Units of bitcoin are not 
				just measured in BTC, you can break them down to 0.00000001 BTC (that is one-one 
				hundred millionth, or eight digits behind the decimal.) Its like a smaller change on the US Dollar. 
				This is referred to as a Satoshi;  after the alias of the creator of Bitcoin.

			<h2>Mobile Wallet Safety Measures and Backing Up</h2>
				<p>Your phone may be stolen, and maybe the theif knows your phone unlock password or it was 
				left unlocked. Most can also almost guarantee your phone isn't coming back. You can actually 
				backup your wallet onto another device, and you should! A spending pin may be added on your 
				wallet to prevent any fraud transaction.
				<br>

				When you have the wallet open on your phone, click on the icon in the top right corner.</p>

			<img
				src="BitcoinWalletExtraOptions.jpg"
				alt="Extra Options Icon in Bitcoin Wallet"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">

				<p>Here we see the list of options we can select, click on the "safety" tab.</p>

			<img
				src="BitcoinWalletSafety.jpg"
				alt="Bitcoin Wallet Safety"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">
				
				<p>You should take some time and read the two options circled in red. It is just 
				some knowlegde you should know as a wallet user. The green option will 
				allow you to create a copy of your wallet.</p>
			
			<img
				src="BitcoinWalletSafetyNotesTechnicalNotesbackUpWallet.jpg"
				alt="Bitcoin Wallet Extra Options"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">

				<p>You should select a strong password. One can be generated here:
				<a href="https://passwordsgenerator.net/" target="_blank">random password generator</a>. 
				One thing you may want to consider is get a small flashdrive that you can store off 
				of your computer. You are the only one who knows the passwords so you do not want to 	
				forget/lose them. You should be able to send them to somewhere else other than your phone. 
				I would advise you to email the file to yourself and save it on your 
				computer or flashdrive, recommend on the flashdrive; just make sure you save it off of your phone.</p>

				src="BitcoinWalletBackUpWallet.png"
				alt="Bitcoin Wallet Back Up Wallet"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">
				
				<p>If you ever need to restore your wallet on your phone, make sure the file is on your phone. 
				If you did not back it up you are out of luck as you have ZERO ways to restore your wealth.
				Once you have it uploaded, select the top right "extra options" icon. You will now want to select 
				"safety", then the "restore wallet" option.</p>
				
			<img 
				src="BitcoinWalletRestoreWallet.jpg"
				alt="Bitcoin Wallet Restore Wallet"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">

				<p>If you have multiple wallet files you can select your most recent file with the green circled 
				drop-down option. You may have different passwords for different wallets. Make sure you record 
				which password is for which wallet.</p>
		
			<img
				src="BitcoinWalletRestoreWalletFileDropdown.jpg"
				alt="Bitcoin Wallet Restore Wallet File Dropdown"
				style="width:250px;height:450px">

				<p>The wallet is able to set up a pin that you must input before you are allowed to spend bitcoins,
				similar to the way a debit card works. You should also write this down in case you forget it, as you
				will have frozen your wallet with the lack of a pin.</p>

    			<h2>Limited Supply</h2>
				<p>There are going to be a lot of numbers, and I apologize for that. Bitcoin, unfortunately for 
				most people, runs on a lot of numbers. I am going to try and keep the numbers to 
				a minimum. That being said, one important number is 21 million. 21 million is the 
				rounded number for the total creation of bitcoins to ever be in existence. There 
				will never be any more ever created, however, they can be destroyed, lost, or forgotten 
				about. The actual number of bitcoins in supply or curculation is way less. With 
				a growing population currently around 7 Billion people, 21 Million whole bitcoins would not 
				work well for a global economy. By having smaller portions of a bitcoin, this feature allows 
				small amounts to be traded to accurately pinpoint a value for the trade.
